# Metropolia eCards Maker

The eCards Maker allows students and personnel of Metropolia UAS to create personalised electronic holiday greeting cards. The user journey is as follows: a user chooses an animation to the front side of the eCard and writes receiver information and a message to the backside. A finished eCard displays the sender's written message after the receiver has watched the animation.

The layout to follows the simplistic style of the Metropolia staff intranet with the organisation's brand guidelines. The end result is a minimalistic graphic design with an emphasis on illustrations with clear and accessible UI. I wanted the user experience to be as intuitive as possible and the user interfaces easy to learn.

From a technical standpoint, the backend of the product is programmed using simple PHP code. The code generates a unique URL per card that can be sent directly to the person of interest or shared via social media sharing options. Users log into the site using their organisational identification which allows the cards to be saved for later use.
